										<h2>Résumé</h2>
										<p>
											&mdash; I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have
											tried to kill me, I don't remember all their names. I have
											been sold like a broodmare. I've been chained and
											betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me
											standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in
											any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys
											Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries
											until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed
											the sea. Any sea. They did for me. I was born to rule the
											Seven Kingdoms, and I will.

											<em>Season 7</em>
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong
												>Is she too impulsive or are her instincts to be
												followed? She learns the answer, but at a cost.</strong
											>
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Arrives at Dragonstone. Invites Jon Snow… to bend the
												knee. But he won't do it. Because of him looses one
												dragon. Fall in love with him. Does it even make a
												sense?
											</li>
											<li>
												Hooks up with Jon in his fur blanket cabin on the way
												home, while Sam and Bran talk about how she’s his aunt.
												Hot. No, gross.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<em>Season 6</em>
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong
												>Well, we don't see her as much in this season.</strong
											>
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Negotiation with the masters of Slavers Bay. She’s
												talking surrender, Drogon drops down off the top of the
												pyramid in the distance. “We’re here to discuss your
												surrender. Not mine.” BOSS. She takes all of the ships
												she doesn’t burn. One master is left to tell the tale.
												All of Slavers Bay is hers again. So. Good.
											</li>
											<li>
												Theon and Yara come to join forces.
												<em>“We are not our fathers.”</em> She agrees to an
												alliance if they stay in the Iron Islands and stop
												raiding. Agreed. Queens.
											</li>
											<li>
												Names Tyrion Hand of the Queen. Sails to Westeros.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<em>Season 5</em>
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong
												>She is ruling, it’s going well, then it’s not… As
												always.</strong
											>
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Meets Tyrion. After much talking, wine and a few
												threats, she decides to keep him as an advisor.
												<em
													>“I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break
													the wheel.”</em
												>
											</li>
											<li>
												She’s trapped in the center of the great pit. Enter
												Drogon. Do you think Drogon doesn’t know when she’s in
												trouble? He does. He comes in and starts f@#8*ing
												everyone up. But, he’s taking a lot of spears and she
												needs to get him out of there before he dies trying to
												defend her. So… let’s ride! They disappear over the
												horizon. Yes yes yes.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<em>Season 4</em>
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>She’s confident and she’s on top.</strong>
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Dragons are bigger than people for the first time. Start
												with some nice dragon time by the sea. That is, until
												they start fighting over a lamb carcass and it becomes
												clear about to cause some sh*@!
											</li>
											<li>
												Going to Meereen. Queen stuff is hard. Goats are being
												dragon-torched. Then Drogon kills a toddler. She can’t
												take it. She chains Viserion and Rhaegal. Drogon is
												nowhere to be found.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<em>Season 3</em>
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong
												>She’s started her conquest. She’s powerful, and clever,
												cunning and full of wrath.</strong
											>
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Sails to Astapor. The dragons are bigger.
												<em>“Not big enough”</em>. She needs an army.
											</li>
											<li>
												Meets the master of the Unsullied. Offers him a dragon
												in return for all 8,000 Unsullied. Done. She takes
												Missandei as a ‘gift’, because she recognizes the
												awesome. Immediately frees her.
											</li>
											<li>
												The exchange. The whip that commands the Unsullied is
												handed over. Drogon is handed over. Once the deal is
												done, she breaks out the Valeryian. Boss. She commands
												the Unsullied to kill the masters, spare the innocents.
												Then, Dracarys! Dragon burns his new master to ash.
												<strong>
													THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SCENES IN THE SERIES.</strong

											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<em>Season 2</em>
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong
												>She’s learning her dragons, and how to be one.</strong
											>
										</p>
										She is in trouble. Again. Her people are starving. Horses
										are dying, including her beautiful white horse… Her dragons
										won’t eat. She only knows to give them meat. She doesn’t
										know the secret is fire. The secret is always fire. At some
										point she figures that out and starts commanding ‘Dracarys’
										so they roast their food.

										<p>
											<em>Season 1</em>
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong
												>She’s in exile and vulnerable. But she doesn’t stay
												that way.
											</strong>
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Daenerys’ only surviving family member (or so we think),
												Viserys, her brother, is a coward and a monster. He
												sells her to Khal Drogo for a chance to take a Dothraki
												Khalasar to Westeros and win the Iron Throne. Also, he’s
												gross and full of bad touch moments.
											</li>
											<li>
												Gets a Dothraki wedding. She’s gifted dragon eggs, which
												everyone just thinks are pretty rocks. The Dothraki are
												a brutal people. People die. Women are raped.
											</li>
											<li>Gets pregnant immediately.</li>
											<li>
												Eats horse heart &#x1F9E1;… throws it up… eats THAT.
												Becomes Dothraki.
											</li>
											<li>
												Baby dies. Drogo dies too. Even Viserys dies! Things are
												so bad. Blood magic is the worst.
											</li>
											<li>
												But wait! Morning comes and Daenerys emerges from the
												ashes with three baby dragons! She is the unburnt. The
												mother of dragons. We know who the real dragon is.
