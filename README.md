# Homepage
My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

## Overview
It's important for employees to know you have the necessary experience to do the work required in the position. Still, many candidates will have this relevant experience. This example of résumé will totally help you to stand out.

## Usage
This Résumé is an MIT-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with ongoing development made possible thanks to the support of **Binary Studio Academy**. This page is hosted on [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), which makes it so much easier to use, and I used [**serve**](https://github.com/zeit/serve) to run my website locally during development. The future plans and high priority features and enhancements can be found in Wiki pages of this repository.

Hope this project will help you with ideas about your resume!
